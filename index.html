        Hi — I’m a current student at NYU majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        I previously worked at Ripple as an Applied Scientist and Software Engineer, and conducted NLP research at the University of Maine on a privacy framework called Prigen.

        I’m interested in web3 and blockchain systems, quantitative finance (quantitative development), soccer, MMA, and related topics.

        I write here to think in public. Feel free to read the posts below or reach out at vjv7099@nyu.edu
